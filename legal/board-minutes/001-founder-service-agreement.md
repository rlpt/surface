## 1. Chair and quorum

Richard Targett acted as Chair of the meeting. The Chair noted that as the Company currently has only one director, the quorum for a board meeting is one in accordance with Article 14(2) of the Company's Articles of Association. The meeting was accordingly quorate.

## 2. Purpose of meeting

The Chair stated that the purpose of the meeting was to consider and approve:

(a) a Deed of Assignment of Intellectual Property Rights between Richard Targett and the Company; and

(b) a Service Agreement between the Company and Richard Targett.

## 3. Declaration of interest

The Chair declared, pursuant to section 177 of the Companies Act 2006, that he has a direct personal interest in the matters to be discussed at this meeting, being:

(a) the proposed assignor under the IP Assignment Deed; and

(b) the proposed employee under the Service Agreement.

The Chair noted that as the sole director of the Company, there are no other directors to whom this declaration can be made in the usual manner. This declaration is recorded in these minutes as a matter of proper corporate governance and to comply with the spirit of section 177.

The Chair further noted that, as the sole member of the Company, he also consents in his capacity as shareholder to the Company entering into these transactions, in accordance with sections 175-177 and 180 of the Act.

## 4. IP Assignment Deed

The Chair presented the proposed Deed of Assignment of Intellectual Property Rights, under which Richard Targett would assign to the Company all intellectual property rights created by him prior to and since the incorporation of the Company, to the extent relating to the Company's business.

The Chair noted the following:

(a) the assigned intellectual property includes the Formabi application source code, the company-as-code system, all brand assets, domain names, and related materials;

(b) the consideration for the assignment is £1.00 and the ordinary shares already held by the Assignor;

(c) the assignment is necessary to ensure that the Company is the legal and beneficial owner of all intellectual property used in its business — without it, the intellectual property would remain the personal property of Richard Targett and the Company would have no assets of substance;

(d) the terms of the Deed are on arm's length terms and are in the best interests of the Company.

**IT WAS RESOLVED** that the Company enter into the IP Assignment Deed in the form presented to the meeting, and that Richard Targett be authorised to execute the Deed on behalf of the Company.

## 5. Service Agreement

The Chair presented the proposed Service Agreement between the Company and Richard Targett, under which Richard Targett would be employed as Chief Executive Officer.

The Chair noted the following key terms and the rationale for each:

### Salary: £0 per annum

The Company is pre-revenue and has limited cash resources. A salary of £0 is appropriate at this stage and is consistent with the position of a sole founder who is funding the Company through their own time and effort. The salary is to be reviewed by the Board following the Company's first funding round. This approach preserves cash for product development and is standard practice for pre-revenue founder-led companies.

### Notice period: 3 months (mutual)

A 3-month notice period balances the Company's need for continuity with the Executive's flexibility. This is within the range that investors at seed stage would expect (typically 3-6 months). A longer period would be disproportionate at this stage.

### Post-termination restrictions: 6 months

The non-compete, non-solicit, and non-dealing restrictions are each limited to 6 months. This period is reasonable and proportionate given:

- the early stage of the Company;
- the limited geographic scope (the Company operates primarily in the UK and online);
- the need to protect the Company's business, customer relationships, and confidential information;
- the requirement under English law that restrictive covenants go no further than reasonably necessary to protect a legitimate business interest.

A restriction of 6 months is at the lower end of the typical range (6-12 months) and is therefore more likely to be enforceable.

### IP assignment

The Service Agreement includes a comprehensive intellectual property assignment clause covering all works created during employment. This complements the IP Assignment Deed (which covers pre-existing IP) and ensures that all intellectual property — past and future — belongs to the Company.

### Working Time Regulations opt-out

The Executive has opted out of the 48-hour weekly working time limit under Regulation 4 of the Working Time Regulations 1998. This is standard for senior executives and founders.

### Overall assessment

The Chair confirmed that:

(a) the terms of the Service Agreement are reasonable, on arm's length terms, and in the best interests of the Company;

(b) the terms are consistent with market practice for sole-founder pre-revenue companies;

(c) the Service Agreement is being entered into to formalise the Executive's relationship with the Company, to ensure proper IP assignment on an ongoing basis, and to establish a governance framework that will satisfy investor due diligence requirements;

(d) no alternative terms were considered that would be more favourable to the Company, given that the Executive's salary is £0 and the restrictive covenants are within the standard range.

**IT WAS RESOLVED** that:

(a) the Company enter into the Service Agreement in the form presented to the meeting;

(b) Richard Targett be authorised to execute the Service Agreement on behalf of the Company;

(c) the Service Agreement take effect from the Commencement Date specified therein.

## 6. Conflict of interest — acknowledgement

The Chair acknowledged that he has approved transactions in which he has a direct personal interest. The Chair recorded the following for the avoidance of doubt:

(a) as sole director, there is no mechanism for the interested director to recuse themselves from the decision — the Act permits a sole director to make decisions notwithstanding their interest;

(b) as sole shareholder, Richard Targett consents to the transactions and waives any right to challenge them on grounds of conflict of interest;

(c) the terms of both the IP Assignment Deed and the Service Agreement have been set at arm's length and on terms that are reasonable and in the best interests of the Company;

(d) these minutes constitute a full and transparent record of the decisions made, the interests declared, and the rationale for the terms approved, so that any future director, shareholder, or investor can understand the basis on which these arrangements were entered into.

## 7. Close

There being no further business, the meeting was closed.
