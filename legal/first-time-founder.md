# First-Time Founder — What Nobody Tells You

Everything outside the legal checklist. The practical, financial, and psychological things that catch UK founders off guard.

---

## Your personal finances

### Before you start spending company money, sort yourself out

The company is a separate legal entity. Its money is not your money. Your money is not its money. Mixing them is the fastest way to create problems with HMRC, investors, and your own sanity.

**Personal runway**: know exactly how many months you can survive on £0 salary. Not "roughly" — exactly. Total your fixed personal costs (rent/mortgage, bills, food, insurance, debt payments, subscriptions) and divide your savings by that number. That is your personal runway. The company's runway is a separate calculation.

**Benefits cliff**: if you were employed, you may lose access to:
- Employer pension contributions
- Private health insurance
- Life insurance / income protection
- Death in service benefit
- Company sick pay

Consider whether you need to replace any of these personally. Income protection insurance is worth looking at — if you are incapacitated and have no employer sick pay, statutory sick pay is £116.75/week.

**Student loans**: Plan 1 and Plan 2 student loan repayments are based on income. If your salary is £0, your repayments drop to £0. But if you later take dividends, those do not trigger student loan repayments (dividends are not "earned income" for student loan purposes). This is a legitimate difference, not a loophole.

**State pension**: National Insurance contributions build your state pension entitlement. You need 35 qualifying years for a full state pension. If your salary is below the NI threshold (currently ~£12,570/year), you are not building NI credits. You can:
- Pay voluntary Class 3 NI contributions (~£17/week) to fill gaps
- Or accept the gap and make it up later when you start drawing salary

This is not urgent but be aware of it. Check your NI record at gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record.

## Directors' duties — what the law requires of you

As a director of a UK company, the Companies Act 2006 imposes seven statutory duties. You must follow these from day one. Breach of duty can result in personal liability — limited liability protects shareholders, not directors.

### The seven duties (sections 171-177)

**1. Act within powers (s.171)**
Exercise powers only for the purposes for which they were conferred. You cannot use company powers for personal benefit.

**2. Promote the success of the company (s.172)**
Act in the way you consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. You must have regard to:
- The likely consequences of any decision in the long term
- The interests of the company's employees
- The need to foster business relationships with suppliers, customers, and others
- The impact on the community and environment
- The desirability of maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
- The need to act fairly between members

This is the most important duty. It means every significant decision should be made in the company's interest, not yours personally. As sole founder and sole shareholder, these interests currently overlap perfectly. They diverge once you have investors.

**3. Exercise independent judgement (s.173)**
Make your own decisions. Do not blindly follow advice without applying your own judgement. You can take advice (and should), but the decision is yours.

**4. Exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence (s.174)**
The standard is both objective (what a reasonably diligent person with the general knowledge, skill, and experience expected of a director would do) and subjective (what a person with your actual knowledge, skill, and experience would do). The higher standard applies. If you are a technical founder, you are held to a higher standard on technical decisions.

**5. Avoid conflicts of interest (s.175)**
Do not put yourself in a position where your personal interests conflict with the company's interests. This is why the board minute for your service agreement matters.

**6. Not accept benefits from third parties (s.176)**
Do not accept personal benefits from people dealing with the company (bribes, gifts, hospitality beyond reasonable levels) that could influence your decisions.

**7. Declare interest in proposed transactions (s.177)**
If you have a personal interest in a transaction the company is entering into, declare it to the board. You did this in the board minute for the service agreement.

### Practical implications

- Keep a paper trail of significant decisions (board minutes, even informal ones)
- When in doubt about a conflict, disclose it
- Do not use company money for personal expenses. Ever. Not even "I'll pay it back." Use a company card for company expenses and a personal card for personal expenses.
- If the company becomes insolvent or approaches insolvency, your duties shift — you must now consider the interests of creditors, not just shareholders. This is when directors get into trouble. See "wrongful trading" below.

## The directors' loan account — the trap

If you put personal money into the company (e.g. buying a domain with your personal card), the company owes you money. This creates a directors' loan account (DLA). Conversely, if you take money out of the company for personal use, you owe the company money.

**Money you put in (company owes you)**: this is fine. Keep receipts. The company can repay you at any time without tax consequences.

**Money you take out (you owe the company)**: this is where it gets dangerous.

- If the loan is over £10,000 at any point in the tax year, HMRC treats it as a benefit in kind — you pay income tax and NI on the value of the benefit, and the company pays Class 1A NI
- The company must pay section 455 corporation tax (33.75%) on the outstanding loan balance. This is refunded when you repay the loan, but the cash flow impact is real.
- If the loan is not repaid within 9 months of the end of the accounting period, the s.455 charge kicks in

**The rule**: do not borrow from your own company. If you need money, pay yourself a salary or dividends through proper channels. If you accidentally put a personal expense on the company card, reimburse the company immediately and record it.

## Salary vs dividends — how to pay yourself

When you start paying yourself, you have two mechanisms:

### Salary (employment income)

- Subject to income tax (PAYE) and National Insurance (both employee and employer)
- Deductible expense for the company (reduces corporation tax)
- Builds state pension / NI credits
- Counts as "earned income" for mortgage applications
- Must run through payroll (PAYE registration with HMRC)

### Dividends (shareholder income)

- Subject to income tax but at lower rates than salary (8.75% basic, 33.75% higher, 39.35% additional — as of 2025/26)
- No National Insurance
- Not deductible for the company (paid from post-tax profits)
- Requires the company to have distributable profits (you cannot pay dividends from an empty or loss-making company)
- Does not count as earned income for student loan repayments or pension auto-enrolment

### The common approach

Most small company directors pay themselves a combination:
- A small salary up to the NI primary threshold (~£12,570/year) — this builds pension credits without triggering NI
- The rest as dividends — taxed at lower rates than salary

**But at pre-revenue with no profits**, you cannot pay dividends (no distributable profits to distribute). So the question is moot until the company is making money. Your salary is £0 as documented in the service agreement. When revenue starts, talk to your accountant about the optimal salary/dividend split.

**Do not set this up yourself.** Get an accountant. The tax implications of getting the split wrong are significant and the rules change annually. An accountant costs £100-200/month for a small company and will save you more than that in tax efficiency.

## HMRC registrations

You may need multiple registrations with HMRC. Which ones depend on your activities:

| Registration | When required | How |
|-------------|--------------|-----|
| **Corporation tax** | Within 3 months of starting any activity (including incorporation if you do anything immediately) | Online at gov.uk. HMRC should send you a letter after incorporation prompting this. If not, register proactively. |
| **PAYE** | Before you first pay anyone (including yourself) a salary above the NI threshold | Online at gov.uk. You do not need this at £0 salary. Register when you start paying yourself or hire someone. |
| **VAT** | When taxable turnover exceeds £90,000 in any 12-month rolling period. You can register voluntarily before this threshold. | Online at gov.uk. Voluntary registration lets you reclaim VAT on purchases but you must charge VAT on sales. At pre-revenue, it may be worth registering early to reclaim VAT on expenses. Ask your accountant. |
| **Self-assessment** | You should already be registered for self-assessment as a company director. HMRC requires directors to file a personal tax return even if their salary is £0. | Online at gov.uk. File by 31 January following the end of the tax year. |

**The one that catches people**: self-assessment. You are a company director. Even at £0 salary, you must file a personal tax return. Failure to file incurs an automatic £100 penalty, escalating the longer you leave it.

## R&D tax credits

You may be eligible for R&D tax relief even at pre-revenue. If you are developing software that involves technical uncertainty (solving problems that a competent professional in the field could not easily resolve), the qualifying expenditure can generate a tax credit.

For small companies (under 500 employees, under €100m turnover):
- You can claim an enhanced deduction on qualifying R&D expenditure
- If the company is loss-making (which it is at pre-revenue), you can surrender the loss for a cash credit from HMRC
- The credit rate has changed recently — as of April 2024, the merged R&D scheme gives a 20% above-the-line credit for most companies, with an enhanced rate of ~27% for R&D-intensive loss-making SMEs

**What qualifies**: staff costs (including your notional salary if you set one), software/cloud costs directly related to R&D, subcontractor costs. Your accountant can advise on what counts.

**When to claim**: with your corporation tax return. You can claim for up to 2 previous accounting periods if you missed earlier claims.

**Practical advice**: keep a log of what you are building and why it is technically challenging. "Building a form builder" may not qualify. "Building a novel EAV-based datalog architecture for dynamic form schemas that cannot be achieved with standard relational database patterns" probably does. The claim is about technical uncertainty, not commercial novelty.

Get a specialist R&D tax advisor. Most work on a contingency basis (they take a percentage of the claim) so there is no upfront cost. Typical fees: 15-25% of the credit received.

## Insurance

### What you need now

**Nothing is legally required** for a company with no employees (other than the sole director) and no physical premises. But consider:

| Insurance | What it covers | When to get it | Cost |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|------|
| **Public liability** | Claims from third parties for injury or damage | When you meet clients or attend events in person | £100-200/year |
| **Professional indemnity (PI)** | Claims that your product/advice caused financial loss | When you have paying customers — some enterprise clients require it contractually | £200-500/year |
| **D&O (Directors & Officers)** | Personal liability for decisions made as a director — defence costs, settlements | When you have investors or a board. Investors often require it. | £1,500-3,000/year |
| **Cyber / data breach** | Costs of a data breach — notification, forensics, regulatory fines, claims | When you process customer data at scale | £300-1,000/year |
| **Employers' liability** | Legally required once you have employees (including yourself if you take a salary) | When you first pay anyone a salary. £2,500 fine per day without it. | £50-200/year |
| **Key person** | Pays out if a critical person (you) dies or is incapacitated | When investors want to protect their investment against you being hit by a bus | £300-1,000/year |

**Priority order**: employers' liability (when you start payroll) > PI (when you have customers) > D&O (when you have investors) > everything else.

## Wrongful trading and your personal exposure

Limited liability means shareholders cannot lose more than their investment. It does NOT mean directors are shielded from everything.

**Wrongful trading** (s.214 Insolvency Act 1986): if you knew (or ought to have known) that the company had no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvency, and you did not take every step to minimise losses to creditors, you can be held personally liable for the company's debts from that point onwards.

**What this means practically**: if the company is running out of money and cannot pay its bills, you cannot keep trading, running up supplier debts, and hoping things will get better. You must either:
- Restructure (cut costs, raise emergency funding)
- Seek professional advice (insolvency practitioner)
- Cease trading

The moment you know (or should know) the company cannot pay its debts as they fall due, your duties shift from shareholders to creditors. Continuing to trade after this point, hoping for a miracle, is wrongful trading.

**Fraudulent trading** (s.213) is worse — carrying on business with intent to defraud creditors. This carries criminal liability.

**Practical safeguard**: monitor cash flow. Know exactly how much runway you have. If you drop below 3 months of runway with no clear path to funding, seek advice. Do not wait until the money runs out.

## The accountant — get one now

You need an accountant. Not eventually. Now.

**What they do for you:**

- File your annual accounts at Companies House
- File your corporation tax return
- File your personal self-assessment return
- Advise on salary/dividend split when you start paying yourself
- Handle PAYE registration and payroll when you hire
- Handle VAT registration and returns when relevant
- Advise on R&D tax credits
- Prepare management accounts (or review yours)
- Prepare the financial information needed for SEIS/EIS applications
- Answer the "can I expense this?" question

**What to look for:**

- Experience with startups / small tech companies (not just high-street accountants who do sole traders and landlords)
- Fixed monthly fee, not hourly billing
- Cloud accounting (Xero or FreeAgent — avoid anyone who asks for paper receipts)
- Responsive (replies within 1-2 business days)
- Can handle R&D tax credit claims (or has a partner who can)

**Cost**: £100-250/month for a startup with no employees and minimal transactions. Increases as complexity grows.

**Recommendations for UK startup accountants:**
- Accounts & Legal (startup-focused, fixed fees)
- Crunch (tech-focused, good value)
- SJD Accountancy (contractor/director focused)
- Any local firm recommended by other founders in your area

Get one before you file your first set of accounts. Cleaning up a year of messy books costs more than keeping them clean from day one.

## Banking

### Business bank account

You should already have one. If not, open one today. Do not use your personal account for company transactions. Options:

| Bank | Monthly cost | Why choose it |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Tide | Free | No-frills, fast to open, good invoicing, integrates with Xero |
| Starling Business | Free | Good app, GBP and EUR accounts, integrates with accounting software |
| Monzo Business | Free (Lite) / £7 (Pro) | Good notifications, pots for earmarking funds |
| Revolut Business | Free (Basic) / £25 (Grow) | Multi-currency, good if you have international expenses |
| HSBC Kinetic | Free for 18 months | Traditional bank backing, useful if you want a business overdraft later |

**Do not use one of the big four (Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds, HSBC) unless you need a specific service they offer.** The neobanks are faster to open, cheaper to run, and integrate better with accounting software.

### Stripe / payment processing

When you start taking payment, set up Stripe. Register it in the company's name with the company's bank account. Do not route payments through your personal Stripe account.

---

## Grants and non-dilutive funding

Before you raise equity (which dilutes your ownership), check if any grants apply:

| Source | What | Amount | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| **Innovate UK Smart Grants** | R&D funding for innovative projects | £25k-£500k | Competitive. Quarterly rounds. 2-3 month assessment. You must match 30-50% of the project cost. |
| **Innovate UK Young Innovators** | For founders under 30 | £5k-£15k + mentoring | Less competitive, good for early stage |
| **British Business Bank Start Up Loans** | Government-backed personal loans for business use | Up to £25k | 6% fixed interest, 1-5 year term, personal liability (not the company's debt). Includes mentoring. |
| **Creative England / Creative Industries** | For tech/creative businesses | Varies | Depends on region and sector |
| **Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP)** | Regional grants | Varies | Check your local LEP for current programmes |
| **University partnerships** | KTP (Knowledge Transfer Partnership) | Covers a graduate salary + costs | If you partner with a university to develop novel technology, Innovate UK funds most of the cost |

**SEIS/EIS is better than grants for speed** — grants take months to apply, months to assess, months to receive. But grants are free money with no dilution. If your timeline allows it, apply for both.

## The practical stuff

### Registered address

Your registered office address is publicly visible on Companies House. Anyone can look it up. If it is your home address, your home address is public. Options:

- **Your home address**: free, simple, but public
- **Registered office service**: £50-150/year. A company like Rapid Formations, 1st Formations, or The Hoxton Mix provides an address for Companies House and forwards statutory mail to you.
- **Co-working space**: if you use one, some offer registered office services included in membership

### Domain and email

- Register domains in the company's name, not your personal name. If the domain is currently registered to you personally, transfer ownership to the company. List it in the IP Assignment Deed.
- Set up email on the company domain (richard@formabi.com). Use Google Workspace or Microsoft 365.

### Software subscriptions

Register SaaS tools (GitHub, hosting, CI/CD, design tools) under the company's account and pay with the company card. These are business expenses that reduce your taxable profit. If they are currently on your personal accounts, migrate them.

### Record keeping

The Companies Act requires you to keep accounting records for 6 years. For a digital company, this means:
- All invoices (issued and received)
- All bank statements
- All receipts for expenses
- All contracts and agreements
- All board minutes and resolutions
- All tax returns and correspondence with HMRC

Store digitally (Google Drive per the document management guide) and keep backups.

## The emotional stuff

### Sole founder isolation

You have no co-founder to talk to. No one who shares the weight. This is the hardest part of being a sole founder and most advice glosses over it.

**What helps:**
- **Find a peer group**: other founders at the same stage. Not a networking event — a small group of 3-5 people who meet regularly and talk honestly. Accelerators often create these. So do communities like Indie Hackers, Hacker News, or local founder meetups.
- **Get a mentor or advisor**: someone who has done it before. Not for advice on code — for advice on everything else. Most experienced founders will give you an hour a month for free if you ask well.
- **Separate work and not-work**: when you work from home and the company is your baby, there is no natural boundary. Set one. It does not have to be a strict 9-5, but you need time when you are not thinking about the company.
- **Exercise**: not productivity advice. Survival advice. Building a company is physically and mentally stressful. Exercise is the most effective intervention for founder mental health. Make it non-negotiable.

### Decision fatigue

As sole founder you make every decision. Technical architecture, legal structure, brand colours, accounting software, which bank account, which domain registrar. Every one. It is exhausting.

**What helps:**
- Make reversible decisions fast. Do not optimise. Pick one and move on.
- Make irreversible decisions slowly. Sleep on them. Write down the options and consequences.
- Batch administrative decisions. Set aside one morning a week for admin (invoices, filings, accounts). Do not let it leak into every day.
- This legal directory you are building is a form of decision-batching. You are making the company structure decisions now, in a concentrated period, so you do not have to make them under pressure later.

### Imposter syndrome

You have never done this before. You will feel like you are making it up as you go. You are. Everyone is. The founders who look like they know what they are doing are also making it up — they are just further along and have forgotten how uncertain the beginning felt.

**What helps:**
- Ship something. The fastest cure for imposter syndrome is showing someone your work and having them find it useful.
- Talk to customers, not other founders. Founders compare themselves to each other. Customers just want their problem solved.
