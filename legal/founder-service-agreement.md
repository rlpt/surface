## 15. Post-termination restrictions

(1) The Executive covenants with the Company that they shall not, for a period of **6 months** following the Termination Date (the **"Restricted Period"**):

(b) **Non-solicit (employees)**: solicit or entice away, or endeavour to solicit or entice away, any person who is at the Termination Date (or was at any time during the 6 months prior to the Termination Date) employed or engaged by the Company in a senior capacity or with whom the Executive had material dealings;

(d) **Non-dealing**: deal with any person who is at the Termination Date (or was at any time during the 12 months prior to the Termination Date) a customer or client of the Company and with whom the Executive had material dealings during that period, if such dealing is in competition with the Company.

(2) Each restriction in clause 15(1) is a separate and independent restriction. If any restriction is held to be void or unenforceable, the remaining restrictions shall remain in full force and effect.

(3) If any restriction is held to be void as being unreasonable but would be valid if some part of it were deleted or the period reduced, the restriction shall apply with such modification as may be necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

(4) The Restricted Period shall be reduced by any period during which the Executive is on Garden Leave under clause 17.

(5) The restrictions in this clause 15 shall not apply if the Executive is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in clause 14(3)) and the Company does not pay the Executive's salary during the Restricted Period.

(6) Nothing in this clause 15 shall prevent the Executive from being engaged in any business or activity which does not compete with the business of the Company.

---

## 16. Company property and records

(2) The Executive shall not remove any Company property from the Company's premises or systems except in the proper performance of their duties.

(3) This clause shall be interpreted broadly: for a remote-working founder, "Company's premises or systems" includes the Executive's development environment, git repositories, cloud services, and any other systems used for Company business.

---

## 17. Garden Leave

(2) If the Executive's employment terminates for any reason, the Executive shall resign as a director of the Company unless the Board requests otherwise. This is subject to any rights the Executive may have under the Articles of Association to remain a director (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any right under the Articles to remain a director while holding a specified percentage of the Company's shares).

---

## 19. Warranties

The Executive warrants and represents that:

(a) they are not prevented by any agreement, arrangement, or obligation from entering into this Agreement or from performing their duties under it;

*Note: As the Executive is the sole director signing on behalf of the Company, there is a technical conflict of interest. While this is legally permissible for a sole-director company, the conflict should be noted in the Company's board minutes. A board minute recording: (a) the terms of the service agreement; (b) the director's interest under s.177 Companies Act 2006; and (c) the rationale for the terms — provides a clean paper trail for investors.*
