# Articles of Association — Founder's Guide

Companion to `articles-of-association.md`. Read this first. The articles are the template; this is how to think about them.

## When to adopt these articles

**Not yet.** Keep the Model Articles until you have a reason to switch.

### Why Model Articles are fine for now

Model Articles (Companies Act 2006, Schedule 1) are thin — but that's the point. With one shareholder there is nobody to protect against, nobody to grant board seats to, nobody who needs pre-emption rights. The bespoke articles are machinery for managing multiple shareholders. Running that machinery with one shareholder is overhead with no benefit.

What Model Articles give you as a sole founder:

- Companies House recognises them without question
- No legal review needed (they are statutory defaults)
- Full control — sole director, sole shareholder, no reserved matters blocking you
- Any resolution is passed by you signing it
- You can act fast — no notice periods to yourself

What the bespoke articles do that you do not need yet:

| Clause | Why it is irrelevant today |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Pre-emption rights | You cannot pre-empt yourself |
| Drag/tag-along | One shareholder cannot drag or tag themselves |
| Board composition | You are the board |
| Investor director appointments | No investors |
| Reserved matters | You would be consenting to yourself |
| Leaver provisions | You cannot leave yourself |

### The trigger: the moment you are about to have a second shareholder

There are three scenarios that trigger adoption:

**1. Equity investment round (most common)**

The bespoke articles are adopted as part of the funding documents. The investor's lawyer will negotiate the terms. Your articles become part of a package alongside the subscription agreement, shareholders' agreement, and disclosure letter.

Adopting articles in advance and then having an investor's lawyer redline them is wasted work — and wasted legal spend. Every investor's counsel will want changes. The template here is your **negotiation starting position**, not a final document.

**2. Issuing shares to a co-founder or early employee**

If you give someone equity (not options), you want pre-emption, vesting, and leaver provisions in place *before* the shares are issued. Once someone holds shares with no transfer restrictions, you have a structural risk — under Model Articles a shareholder can theoretically transfer shares to anyone without your consent.

**3. Setting up an EMI option scheme**

You can technically run EMI under Model Articles, but most advisors recommend bespoke articles at the same time because EMI exercise creates new shareholders.

### The adoption process

When the time comes:

1. **Special resolution** — pass a written special resolution to adopt new articles in substitution for the existing Model Articles. Since you hold 100% of voting rights, you pass it alone.
2. **File at Companies House** — Form CC04 (change of articles) with the full text of the new articles attached. Filing fee is negligible.
3. **Timing** — file the special resolution and new articles at the same time as (or immediately before) the share allotment that creates your new shareholders.

The entire thing can be done in a day. There is no advantage to doing it months in advance.

## How to use the template now

The template is your **negotiation starting position**. When an investor comes to the table, you share this and say "here are our proposed articles." Their lawyer redlines it. Knowing what every clause does — and where the negotiation pressure points are — means you are not starting from zero.

### Common investor negotiation points

These are the clauses investors push hardest on. Know your position before they arrive.

#### Drag-along threshold (article 33)

The template says 75%. Investors may push for a simple majority (50%+1).

- **75%** protects you as founder — an investor with 30% cannot drag you into a sale you disagree with
- **50%+1** gives investors more flexibility to force a sale, especially if they hold a significant minority
- **Typical outcome**: 75% at seed, may drop to 66.7% or lower at Series A+ where investors collectively hold more

**Your position**: hold at 75% for as long as possible. This is one of your strongest protections.

#### Liquidation preference (article 49)

The template drafts a 1x non-participating preference — the investor gets back their money OR converts to ordinary shares and takes pro rata, whichever is higher. This is founder-friendly.

Investors may push for:

- **1x participating** ("double dip") — they get their money back AND then share in the remaining proceeds pro rata. This significantly reduces what ordinary shareholders receive on a modest exit.
- **Multiple (2x, 3x)** — they get 2x or 3x their investment back before ordinary shareholders see anything. Rare at seed, more common in later rounds or down rounds.

**Your position**: 1x non-participating is market standard for UK seed. Resist participating unless you have no leverage. If you must accept participating, push for a cap (e.g. 3x return, after which it converts).

#### Anti-dilution (article 50)

The template uses broad-based weighted average. This is the founder-friendly option.

Investors may push for:

- **Full ratchet** — if a down round happens, the investor's conversion price drops to the new lower price as if they had invested at that price. This is punitive to founders and massively dilutive.
- **Narrow-based weighted average** — less dilutive than full ratchet but more dilutive than broad-based, because it uses a smaller denominator in the calculation.

**Your position**: broad-based weighted average is market standard in the UK. Full ratchet is a red flag — it signals an investor who expects the company to struggle.

#### Reserved matter thresholds (Schedule 1)

The template sets thresholds at:

- Borrowing/capex: £25,000
- Contracts: £50,000/year or £100,000 aggregate
- Director/employee pay changes: £75,000/year

These are set at typical pre-seed/seed levels. They should scale with the company:

| Stage | Borrowing/capex | Contracts | Pay threshold |
|-------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Pre-seed/seed | £25k | £50k/£100k | £75k |
| Series A | £100k | £200k/£500k | £120k |
| Series B+ | £250k+ | £500k+/£1m+ | Negotiate |

**Your position**: make sure the thresholds are workable for day-to-day operations. Too low and you need investor consent for routine spending. Too high and the protections are meaningless. The key test: "will I hit this threshold in normal operations within 6 months?" If yes, it is too low.

#### Board seats (article 9)

The template gives investors:

- One board seat on first funding round
- A second seat if they take 25%+ of issued share capital
- The founder stays as director while holding ≥10%

Investors may push for:

- A board seat at a lower threshold
- Board majority (two investor directors vs one founder director) — resist this strenuously
- Chair to rotate to an investor director

**Your position**: the founder should maintain board control at seed. A common structure is 2:1 (two founder-side directors, one investor director) or 2:1:1 (two founder, one investor, one independent). Never give up board majority at seed.

#### Vesting (article 35)

The template uses 25% immediate + 36-month monthly vesting, triggered at the first funding round. This is favourable to the founder because:

- No vesting applies while you are the sole shareholder (pre-investment work is not at risk)
- 25% immediate means you keep a quarter even if things go wrong immediately after funding
- Monthly vesting (not quarterly or annual cliff) means smooth accumulation

Investors may push for:

- A 12-month cliff before any vesting begins (standard in the US, less common in UK seed)
- A longer vesting period (48 months instead of 36)
- Reverse vesting on all shares from day one, not just from funding

**Your position**: the template position is good. The key argument is that you have been building before investment — the 25% immediate vest recognises pre-investment work. Push back hard on any attempt to reverse-vest shares you held before funding.

## Clause-by-clause reference

What each part of the articles does, in plain language.

### Part 1 — Interpretation (articles 1-3)

Definitions. The £0.0001 nominal value per ordinary share is standard for UK startups — it means you can issue 10,000 shares for £1, keeping the share price low and flexible for option schemes.

### Part 2 — Directors (articles 4-7)

Standard director powers. Nothing unusual. Article 6 lets you delegate to committees — useful later for audit committee, remuneration committee, etc. Not needed at seed.

### Part 3 — Board composition (articles 8-18)

This is where control lives.

- **Article 8(2)**: you can be sole director pre-investment. After investment, minimum two directors in practice (you + investor director).
- **Article 9(4)**: your right to remain a director while holding ≥10% of ordinary shares. This is your safety net — even after multiple dilutive rounds, you stay on the board until you drop below 10%.
- **Article 10(2)**: investors cannot remove you as director under s.168 Companies Act while you hold ≥10%. This blocks the "fire the founder" scenario.
- **Article 15**: you are Chair. The Chair runs meetings and sets the agenda — this is soft power but real power.
- **Article 16**: your casting vote disappears when preferred shares are issued. This is standard — investors will not accept a structure where you can unilaterally break ties.
- **Article 18**: observer rights. A compromise between a board seat and nothing. Investors who do not get a board seat often get an observer seat instead.

### Part 4 — Reserved matters (articles 19-20)

The investor's veto list. After funding, you cannot do any of the 23 things in Schedule 1 without investor consent. This is normal and expected. The negotiation is about the thresholds, not the principle.

Article 20 (deadlock) matters when the board cannot agree. The escalation path is: 30 days deadlock → refer to appointers → 20 days good faith negotiation → CEDR mediation. This avoids litigation as a first resort.

### Part 5 — Share capital (articles 21-24)

Framework for issuing different classes of shares. Article 21(2) lists the typical rights that preferred shares carry — but the actual terms are set in the subscription agreement for each round, not hardcoded here. This gives flexibility for different rounds to have different terms.

### Part 6 — Pre-emption on transfer (articles 25-32)

The core transfer restriction. No shareholder can sell to an outsider without first offering to existing shareholders. The timeline:

```
Seller gives Transfer Notice
    ↓ 10 Business Days
Company sends Offer Notice to all other members
    ↓ 20 Business Days (Acceptance Period)
Members accept/decline
    ↓ 10 Business Days
Completion (if all taken up)
    OR
    ↓ 60 Business Days
Seller may sell to outsider at same or higher price
```

Total timeline: worst case ~100 Business Days (~5 months) from notice to external sale. This is slow by design — it gives existing shareholders time to act.

**Permitted transfers** (article 30): transfers to family, trusts, or nominees bypass pre-emption. This lets you do estate planning without triggering the full process.

**Death** (article 32): your personal representatives can either register as shareholders or transfer — but transfers are still subject to pre-emption. This protects the company from unwanted shareholders while respecting the estate.

### Part 7 — Drag and tag (articles 33-34)

**Drag-along**: if 75%+ of shareholders want to sell the entire company, they can force the remaining shareholders to sell too, on the same terms. The power of attorney in article 33(4) means a holdout shareholder cannot block the deal by refusing to sign — a director signs for them. This is essential for a clean exit.

**Tag-along**: if someone tries to sell 50%+ of the company, minority shareholders can tag along and sell their shares too, on the same terms. This protects minorities from a change of control where the new majority has no obligation to them.

The interplay: drag protects the majority from holdouts. Tag protects the minority from being left behind. Both use the same price per share, adjusted for class rights (so preferred shareholders get their liquidation preference before ordinary shareholders calculate their per-share amount).

### Part 8 — Vesting and leavers (articles 35-40)

**Vesting** (article 35): only kicks in at first funding. Pre-investment, you own 100% outright with no restrictions. Post-investment, 25% vests immediately, 75% over 36 months. Change of control accelerates everything — if the company is sold, all your shares vest so you get full value.

**Good Leaver** (article 37): death, incapacity, fired without cause, constructive dismissal, or resignation with board consent. Good Leavers get Fair Market Value for unvested shares — they are not punished.

**Bad Leaver** (article 38): voluntary resignation or fired for cause (fraud, gross misconduct, criminal conviction, breach of fiduciary duty). Bad Leavers get nominal value — effectively forfeit their unvested shares.

**Fair Market Value** (article 40): agreed between parties, or determined by an independent chartered accountant. The ICAEW President appoints if the parties cannot agree on a valuer. This avoids litigation.

The leaver provisions apply to anyone with shares subject to vesting — not just the founder. When you issue shares to employees or co-founders later, the same mechanism applies.

### Part 9 — General meetings (articles 41-46)

Standard Companies Act procedure. The key investor protection is article 42(2)(a) — after funding, the quorum for general meetings includes at least one investor shareholder. This means you cannot pass shareholder resolutions without investor presence.

### Part 10 — Dividends (articles 47-48)

Standard. Dividends require board recommendation and ordinary resolution. The practical effect: you cannot extract cash via dividends without investor consent (because it is a reserved matter in Schedule 1, item 4).

### Part 11 — Liquidation preference (article 49)

On winding up or sale, the investor gets the higher of:

- Their money back (1x subscription price + unpaid dividends), OR
- What they would get if they converted to ordinary shares and took pro rata

This is 1x non-participating. The investor never loses money on a total loss scenario (they get priority), but on a large exit they convert and share proportionally with ordinary shareholders.

**Example** — investor puts in £500k for 20% of the company:

| Exit value | Investor gets (non-participating) | Founder gets |
|------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| £250k | £250k (all of it — liquidation preference capped at available assets) | £0 |
| £500k | £500k (1x preference) | £0 |
| £1m | £500k (preference) or £200k (20% pro rata) → takes £500k | £500k |
| £5m | £500k (preference) or £1m (20% pro rata) → converts, takes £1m | £4m |
| £50m | Converts, takes £10m (20%) | £40m |

If this were 1x participating, the investor would take their £500k back AND 20% of the remainder. On a £5m exit: £500k + 20% of £4.5m = £1.4m instead of £1m. The difference grows with exit size.

### Part 12 — Anti-dilution (article 50)

Protects investors if you raise at a lower valuation later (a "down round"). Broad-based weighted average adjusts the conversion ratio — the investor's preferred shares convert into more ordinary shares, partially compensating for the lower price.

The exclusions in article 50(3) are important — EMI options, convertible notes, and acquisitions do not trigger anti-dilution. Without these carve-outs, routine share issuances would trigger adjustments.

### Part 13 — Information rights (article 51)

Investors with 5%+ get monthly management accounts within 30 days of month end. This is a real operational commitment — you need to produce management accounts monthly. Start this discipline now, even without investors, so it is not a scramble later.

### Part 14 — Conversion (article 52)

Preferred shares convert to ordinary shares 1:1 (adjusted for anti-dilution and reorganisations). Automatic conversion on IPO or investor election. This is standard — at IPO, all shares become ordinary to simplify the listing.

### Part 15 — Miscellaneous (articles 53-57)

D&O indemnity and insurance (article 53) — get D&O insurance when you have a board. Budget £1,500-3,000/year at seed stage.

Everything governed by English law (article 57). Non-negotiable for a company incorporated in England.

### Schedule 1 — Reserved matters

23 items. The investor's checklist of things you cannot do without asking. Read every one and test it against your operations: "would I hit this in normal business?" If yes, negotiate the threshold up.

The items that bite most often at seed stage:

- **Item 9** (borrowing >£25k): if you plan to use invoice financing, R&D tax credit loans, or any debt facility, £25k may be too low
- **Item 11** (capex >£25k): a single server purchase or office fit-out could hit this
- **Item 18** (pay changes >£75k): if your first engineering hire will earn more than £75k, every salary review needs investor consent
- **Item 19** (contracts >£50k/year): AWS, Google Cloud, or a significant SaaS contract could hit this

### Schedule 2 — Deed of adherence

Template for new shareholders to sign. Anyone who receives shares (by transfer or allotment) signs this to confirm they are bound by the articles. Without it, a new shareholder could argue they are not party to the restrictions.

## What to do right now

1. **Read the template** — understand every clause so you are not learning during a funding negotiation
2. **Keep Model Articles** — do not file the bespoke articles at Companies House yet
3. **Get a solicitor relationship** — you do not need them on retainer, but have someone identified. Recommendations for UK startup solicitors:
   - SeedLegals (automated, cheaper, good for seed)
   - Orrick (top-tier VC firm, expensive but thorough)
   - Taylor Wessing (strong UK startup practice)
   - Shoosmiths (good mid-market option)
   - Keystone Law (flexible, consultant model, often cheaper)
4. **Budget £1,500-3,000** for articles review when the time comes. This is the cost of a solicitor reviewing and customising the template for your specific situation.
5. **Start producing monthly management accounts now** — even if it is just a spreadsheet. When investors arrive and article 51 kicks in, you need this to be routine, not a scramble.

## The one exception: adopt early if you issue shares to anyone

If you issue shares to a co-founder, advisor, or employee before a funding round, adopt the bespoke articles first. Model Articles have almost no transfer restrictions — a shareholder could theoretically transfer shares to anyone without your consent. The pre-emption rights in articles 25-32 close this gap.

The sequence:

1. Pass special resolution to adopt bespoke articles
2. File Form CC04 at Companies House
3. Then allot the new shares

Never the other way around.
