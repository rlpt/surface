# SEIS/EIS — Founder's Guide

Tax relief schemes that make angel investment in your company dramatically cheaper for investors. This is about your investors' tax, not yours.

---

## What these schemes are

SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme) and EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme) are UK government programmes that give individual investors tax relief when they invest in qualifying early-stage companies. They are administered by HMRC.

The schemes exist because early-stage investing is risky. The government subsidises the risk by giving the investor tax breaks, which makes the effective cost of the investment much lower. For founders, this means UK angels are far more likely to invest — and many will not invest at all without SEIS/EIS qualification.

### What the investor gets

#### SEIS (the better one — use this first)

| Relief | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Income tax relief** | 50% of the amount invested, deducted from the investor's income tax bill |
| **Capital gains tax exemption** | If the investor holds for 3+ years, any gain on selling the shares is completely tax-free |
| **Capital gains reinvestment relief** | If the investor reinvests a capital gain into SEIS shares, 50% of the reinvested gain is exempt from CGT |
| **Loss relief** | If the company fails, the investor can offset their loss (net of income tax relief already received) against income tax or CGT |

**Example**: an investor puts £50,000 into your SEIS round.

- They get £25,000 back as income tax relief (50%)
- Their effective cost is £25,000
- If the company succeeds and they sell after 3 years, the gain is tax-free
- If the company fails completely, they lose £25,000 (not £50,000) and can offset that loss against other income at their marginal rate — if they pay 45% income tax, the loss relief is worth £11,250, so total loss is £13,750 on a £50,000 investment

The downside protection is extraordinary. An investor paying 45% income tax who invests £50,000 through SEIS risks only £13,750 if the company goes to zero. That is a 72.5% effective subsidy.

#### EIS (still good — use after SEIS is exhausted)

| Relief | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Income tax relief** | 30% of the amount invested |
| **Capital gains tax exemption** | If held for 3+ years, any gain is tax-free |
| **Capital gains deferral** | Investor can defer a capital gain by reinvesting into EIS shares (the gain is deferred, not exempted) |
| **Loss relief** | Same as SEIS — loss net of income tax relief can be offset against income |

EIS is less generous than SEIS but has much higher limits (£12m lifetime vs £350k).

### Why this matters for fundraising

Most UK angel investors expect SEIS/EIS. When you pitch, the conversation is not "do you offer SEIS?" — it is assumed. Not having SEIS/EIS qualification is a deal-breaker for many angels because:

1. The effective cost of their investment is 50-72.5% lower with SEIS
2. The downside protection transforms the risk profile
3. Many angel networks and syndicates have SEIS/EIS as a mandatory filter
4. Fund managers investing via EIS funds can only deploy into EIS-qualifying companies

Getting advance assurance is not a nice-to-have. It is a prerequisite for raising angel money in the UK.

## Qualification criteria

### SEIS

Your company must meet ALL of these:

| Criterion | Requirement | Formabi status |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **UK-based** | Must carry on a qualifying trade in the UK, or be preparing to do so | Yes — UK incorporated, UK operations |
| **Age** | Must be less than 2 years old from the date it began trading (not incorporation) | **Not yet trading — clock has not started.** See note below |
| **Employees** | Fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees at the time shares are issued | Yes — currently 1 |
| **Gross assets** | Must not exceed £350,000 immediately before the share issue | Yes — newly incorporated, minimal assets |
| **Total SEIS raised** | Lifetime maximum of £350,000 raised under SEIS | N/A — not yet raised |
| **No prior investment** | Must not have previously received investment under EIS, VCT, or social investment tax relief | Yes — no prior qualifying investment |
| **Independence** | Must not be controlled by another company, and must not control any subsidiary (with some exceptions) | Yes — independent |
| **Qualifying trade** | Must carry on or prepare to carry on a qualifying trade | Yes — "preparing to trade" explicitly qualifies. SaaS is a qualifying trade. See excluded trades below |
| **Risk to capital** | The investment must carry genuine risk — there must be a significant risk that the investor could lose their capital | Yes — pre-revenue startup |

#### The trading clock — why pre-trading is the best position

The 2-year SEIS age limit runs from the date the company **begins to trade**, not from incorporation. "Trading" means carrying on a commercial activity with a view to profit. HMRC's definition:

| Activity | Is this "trading"? |
|----------|-------------------|
| Writing code / building the product | No — preparing to trade |
| Hiring employees to build the product | No — preparing to trade |
| Buying equipment, servers, domains | No — preparing to trade |
| Market research, customer discovery | No — preparing to trade |
| Setting up the company, opening bank accounts | No — preparing to trade |
| Building a website to attract future customers | No — preparing to trade |
| Running a free beta / pilot with no payment | Grey area — likely no, but take advice |
| Invoicing your first paying customer | **Yes — trading has begun** |
| Signing a paid contract for services | **Yes — trading has begun** |
| Receiving payment for the product | **Yes — trading has begun** |

**Formabi is pre-trading.** The SEIS 2-year clock has not started. This means:

1. You can take as long as you need building the product before the clock starts
2. You can raise SEIS money while pre-trading (the scheme explicitly allows companies "preparing to carry on a qualifying trade")
3. The 2-year window only begins when you make your first commercial sale
4. You could theoretically incorporate, build for 3 years, start trading, and still have 2 years of SEIS eligibility from that point

**This is the strongest possible position for SEIS.** You have maximum flexibility on timing. There is no urgency driven by the clock — only the urgency of when you actually need the money.

**What to watch for**: the moment you charge anyone for anything — even a small pilot fee — the clock starts. If you want to run paid pilots while preserving SEIS eligibility, plan the timing. Once the first invoice goes out, you have 2 years.

### EIS

Same broad structure but with higher limits:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **UK permanent establishment** | Must have a UK permanent establishment (does not need to be UK-incorporated, but Formabi is) |
| **Age** | Must be less than 7 years from first commercial sale (or 10 years for knowledge-intensive companies) |
| **Employees** | Fewer than 250 FTE |
| **Gross assets** | Must not exceed £15m before the share issue, £16m after |
| **Total EIS raised** | Lifetime maximum of £12m (including SEIS) |
| **Annual limit** | Maximum £5m raised under EIS in any 12-month period |
| **Independence** | Same as SEIS |
| **Qualifying trade** | Same as SEIS |

### Excluded trades

These trades do NOT qualify for SEIS or EIS:

- Dealing in land, commodities, futures, shares, securities, or other financial instruments
- Dealing in goods other than normal wholesale/retail
- Banking, insurance, money-lending, debt factoring, hire purchase financing
- Leasing or receiving royalties or licence fees (with exceptions for intellectual property the company created)
- Providing legal or accountancy services
- Property development
- Farming
- Forestry
- Operating or managing hotels, guest houses, nursing homes (with exceptions)
- Shipbuilding
- Producing coal, steel
- Running a nuclear power station
- Generating or exporting electricity (with feed-in tariff exceptions)
- Operating/managing a road toll

**Formabi**: software as a service (SaaS) is a qualifying trade. You are not in any excluded category. The only trap to watch for is if a significant portion of revenue comes from licensing fees for IP you did not create — unlikely for a form builder.

---

## The process — step by step

### Step 1: Check qualification (do now)

Go through the criteria tables above. For Formabi the likely issues are:

- **Age for SEIS**: the 2-year clock starts from when the company began trading, not incorporation. "Trading" means carrying on commercial activity with a view to profit. If the company was incorporated in June 2024 and began trading immediately, the SEIS window closes around June 2026. If it began trading later (e.g. building product before first revenue), the window may be longer. Get a definitive date.
- **Gross assets for SEIS**: must be under £350k immediately before the share issue. If you have raised any money, bought any equipment, or hold any IP on the balance sheet, check the total.

### Step 2: SEIS Advance Assurance (SEIS1 form) — do before raising

Submit HMRC form SEIS1. This is an application asking HMRC to confirm in advance that your company qualifies for SEIS. It is not mandatory — you can issue shares and apply afterwards — but advance assurance is strongly recommended because:

- Investors will ask "do you have advance assurance?" and expect yes
- If HMRC says no after you have raised, the investors lose their tax relief and you have a very angry cap table
- The process takes 6-8 weeks, so you need to plan ahead

**What you submit with SEIS1:**

| Document | What HMRC wants to see |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Business plan** | What the company does, the product, the market, the business model. Does not need to be a 50-page document — 5-10 pages covering problem, solution, market, revenue model, team, and 2-year roadmap is sufficient |
| **Financial projections** | 2-3 year profit and loss forecast. Revenue projections, cost base, when you expect to break even. These do not need to be precise — HMRC is checking that the business model is commercial, not that your forecasts are accurate |
| **Cap table** | Current shareholding structure. Who holds what, at what nominal value. Post-money cap table showing what the structure will look like after the proposed SEIS raise |
| **Use of funds** | How the SEIS money will be spent. Be specific: "£X on engineering salaries, £Y on cloud infrastructure, £Z on marketing." HMRC wants to see the money goes to trading activities, not sat in a bank or used for non-qualifying purposes |
| **Details of proposed share issue** | Class of shares (usually preferred), price per share, total amount being raised, anticipated date of share issue |
| **Articles of association** | Your current articles (Model Articles for now; the bespoke articles when adopted) |
| **Confirmation of qualifying trade** | A statement that the company carries on (or is preparing to carry on) a qualifying trade and does not carry on any excluded trade |

**Where to submit**: HMRC's Small Company Enterprise Centre (SCEC). The form can be submitted online via HMRC's digital service or by post.

**Timeline**: HMRC targets 6-8 weeks for a response. In practice it can take longer during busy periods (January-March tax year end is the busiest). Apply at least 10 weeks before you plan to close your round.

**Cost**: free. No HMRC fee for advance assurance applications.

**Response**: HMRC will either confirm the company qualifies (advance assurance granted) or raise queries. If queries, you respond and the clock restarts. If refused, you can appeal or restructure and reapply.

### Step 3: EIS Advance Assurance (EIS1 form) — apply simultaneously

You can and should apply for both SEIS and EIS advance assurance at the same time. Use form EIS1 for EIS. The information required is nearly identical to SEIS1.

Why apply for both even if you are only raising SEIS now:

- The EIS assurance is ready when you exhaust your £350k SEIS allowance
- Some investors may prefer EIS (e.g. if they have already used their SEIS annual allowance elsewhere)
- It shows investors you have your compliance in order
- It costs nothing extra

### Step 4: Raise and issue shares

Once you have advance assurance, you can raise with confidence. The share issue process:

1. Agree terms with investors (price per share, number of shares, class of shares)
2. Adopt bespoke articles if not already done (see articles-guide.md)
3. Board resolution to allot shares (requires s.551 authority)
4. Subscription agreements signed by each investor
5. Shareholders' agreement signed by all parties
6. Shares allotted, share certificates issued, register of members updated
7. File SH01 (return of allotment) at Companies House within one month

### Step 5: Compliance Statement (SEIS2/EIS2) — file after shares are issued

After issuing shares to investors, you must file a compliance statement with HMRC:

- **SEIS2** for SEIS shares
- **EIS2** for EIS shares

This confirms that the company still meets the qualifying conditions at the time the shares were actually issued (advance assurance was a forward-looking check; the compliance statement is a backward-looking confirmation).

**Timeline**: file within 2 years of the end of the tax year in which the shares were issued. But do it immediately — your investors cannot claim their tax relief until you do, and they will chase you.

**What you confirm**: the company met all qualifying conditions, the shares were issued for genuine new consideration, the money is being used for the qualifying trade.

### Step 6: SEIS3/EIS3 certificates — send to investors

After HMRC approves the compliance statement, they generate SEIS3/EIS3 certificates. You send these to each investor. The investor attaches the certificate to their self-assessment tax return to claim the income tax relief.

**Timeline**: HMRC typically processes compliance statements within 4-6 weeks. During tax year end (January-April), it takes longer.

The investor needs the certificate to claim relief. If you delay filing the compliance statement, the investor cannot claim. Some investors will time their investment to fall in a specific tax year — be aware of the 5 April year-end.

## The spending rules — the traps

### SEIS: the 70% rule

Before you can raise under EIS, you must have spent at least 70% of the money raised under SEIS on qualifying business activity. This catches people who try to raise SEIS and EIS simultaneously or in quick succession.

**Example**: you raise £200k under SEIS. Before you can issue EIS shares, you must have spent at least £140k of the SEIS money on the business. If you raise SEIS in January and want to raise EIS in March, you probably have not spent 70% yet — HMRC will refuse the EIS compliance statement.

**Planning implication**: raise SEIS first, spend it building the product and hiring, then raise EIS when you are ready. Do not try to raise both at the same time. A typical sequence:

```
Month 0:    SEIS advance assurance granted
Month 1-2:  Raise SEIS round (up to £350k)
Month 2-8:  Build product, hire, spend SEIS money
Month 8:    70% of SEIS money spent
Month 9:    EIS round opens
Month 9-12: Raise EIS round
```

### SEIS: money must not be spent before shares are issued

The SEIS investment must be used for the qualifying trade, but the company must not have spent the specific SEIS money before the shares are actually issued. This sounds contradictory but it means: the investor's money must arrive and shares must be issued before that money is deployed. In practice:

- Investor sends money (held in the company's account)
- Shares are issued (board resolution, SH01 filed)
- Then you spend the money

Do not use an investor's wire transfer to pay a bill before you have formally allotted the shares. If there is a gap — money in but shares not yet issued — keep the money untouched in the account until allotment is complete.

### EIS: connected persons

An investor who is "connected" to the company does not qualify for EIS relief. Connected means:

- An employee or director of the company (with some exceptions — see below)
- A business partner of a connected person
- A spouse or civil partner of a connected person
- A person who holds or is entitled to acquire 30% or more of the company's share capital

**The founder exception for SEIS**: unlike EIS, SEIS does allow directors and employees to invest and claim relief, provided they were not connected at the time they subscribed and their directorship/employment began after the share issue or at the same time. In practice, this means a founder who was a director before the SEIS share issue IS connected for SEIS purposes and cannot claim SEIS relief on their own investment.

**The practical impact**: you (Richard) cannot invest in your own SEIS/EIS round and claim tax relief. The schemes are for external investors only.

### EIS: no pre-arranged exit

If there is an arrangement for the investor to sell their shares within 3 years, the relief is withdrawn. This includes buy-back arrangements, put options, or any other mechanism that guarantees the investor can exit. The investment must carry genuine risk.

### EIS: share class

SEIS/EIS shares must be ordinary shares (or shares that carry no preferential right to the company's assets on winding up beyond a right to the return of the amount subscribed). In practice, this means:

- SEIS/EIS shares can be a separate class of ordinary share with some additional rights (information rights, consent rights)
- They cannot be preference shares with a liquidation preference
- The "ordinary shares" in the articles of association are suitable for SEIS/EIS

**Important tension**: institutional investors want preferred shares with a liquidation preference. Angel investors want SEIS/EIS relief. You cannot have both on the same shares. The solution is typically to issue SEIS/EIS-qualifying ordinary shares to angels at seed, and preferred shares to institutional investors at Series A (by which time you have likely exhausted SEIS and possibly EIS anyway).

| **CGT reinvestment relief** | 50% exempt | Deferral only (not exempt) |
| **Loss relief** | Yes | Yes |
| **Max company can raise** | £350k lifetime | £12m lifetime (£5m/year) |
| **Max investor can claim per year** | £200k (on £200k investment) | £300k/year if carrying back (on £1m investment; £2m if knowledge-intensive) |
| **Company age limit** | < 2 years from trading | < 7 years (10 for knowledge-intensive) |
| **Employee limit** | < 25 FTE | < 250 FTE |
| **Gross asset limit** | < £350k before issue | < £15m before / £16m after |

## Raise sequencing for Formabi

Recommended sequence based on current stage (just incorporated, pre-trading, sole founder, no prior investment):

**Formabi is in the strongest possible SEIS position.** Pre-trading means no clock pressure. All qualification criteria are met. The only question is when you want to raise.

```
NOW (pre-trading, no urgency)
├── All SEIS criteria met ✓
├── Prepare business plan, projections, use of funds (when ready to raise)
└── Submit SEIS1 + EIS1 to HMRC (both at once, 6-8 weeks before you want to close)

+6-8 weeks: advance assurance received

RAISE SEIS (can happen before or after trading begins — both are fine)
├── Find angel investors
├── Agree terms (on SEIS-qualifying ordinary shares)
├── Adopt bespoke articles (see articles-guide.md)
├── Issue shares, file SH01
├── File SEIS2 compliance statement immediately
└── Send SEIS3 certificates to investors when received

START TRADING (first paying customer — the 2-year SEIS clock starts here)
├── You can still raise more SEIS (up to the £350k lifetime cap)
├── You have 2 years from this date to use remaining SEIS allowance
└── Note: the shares must be issued within the 2-year window

+6-12 months after SEIS: 70% of SEIS money spent

EIS ROUND
├── Confirm 70% spending threshold met
├── Find further investors
├── Issue shares (still ordinary shares for EIS qualification)
├── File EIS2 compliance statement
└── Send EIS3 certificates to investors
```

**Key timing decision**: you do not need to wait until you are ready to raise before applying for advance assurance, but there is no point applying years in advance either. HMRC advance assurance is valid for a specific proposed share issue. If your plans change significantly (different amount, different use of funds), you may need to reapply. A good rule: apply when you are 3-4 months away from wanting to close a round.

### Amounts

- SEIS: raise up to £350k. Typical pre-seed/seed angels invest £10k-£50k each, so you need ~7-35 investors for a full SEIS round.
- EIS: raise up to £5m per year / £12m lifetime. This covers seed extension through Series A territory.
- Total tax-efficient angel capacity: £350k (SEIS) + up to £12m (EIS) = up to £12.35m before you exhaust both schemes.

### Timing relative to tax year (5 April)

Many angel investors time their investments around the tax year:

- **January-March** is the busiest period — investors want to use their current year's SEIS/EIS allowance before 5 April
- SEIS/EIS relief can be carried back to the previous tax year — an investment made in April 2026 can be claimed against 2025-26 income tax
- Investors often ask "can you close before 5 April?" — be ready for this

| Prepare use of funds breakdown | When 3-4 months from raising | Free (your time) | Not yet needed |
| Submit SEIS1 + EIS1 advance assurance | 8-10 weeks before you want to close | Free | Not yet — apply when you have investors lined up |
| Wait for HMRC response | 6-8 weeks after submission | — | — |
| File SEIS2/EIS2 after share issue | Within days of issuing shares | Free | — |
| Send SEIS3/EIS3 certificates to investors | When received from HMRC | Free | — |
| **Track when trading begins** | **Ongoing — note the exact date** | Free | **Pre-trading. The 2-year SEIS clock starts on your first commercial sale.** |

The entire SEIS/EIS process is free. HMRC does not charge for any of the forms or certificates. Your only cost is time, unless you use an accountant or solicitor to help with the application (typical cost: £500-1,500 for an accountant to prepare and submit the advance assurance application).

**The one thing to do now**: make a note of the exact date when Formabi starts trading (first invoice, first paid contract, first revenue of any kind). You will need this date for every SEIS/EIS form. If you are unsure whether a particular activity counts as trading, ask your accountant before doing it.

## Common mistakes

1. **Not applying for advance assurance** — raising without it and then finding out you do not qualify. Investors lose tax relief. Relationships damaged.

2. **Missing the 70% spending rule** — trying to raise EIS before spending 70% of SEIS money. HMRC refuses the EIS2 compliance statement.

3. **Spending SEIS money before allotting shares** — using an investor's wire transfer before the board has formally allotted the shares. HMRC can refuse SEIS relief for those shares.

4. **Issuing preference shares** — SEIS/EIS shares cannot carry a liquidation preference. Giving angels the same preferred shares as institutional investors disqualifies the tax relief.

5. **Exceeding the 2-year SEIS window** — not realising that "trading" started earlier than you thought. The moment you invoice anyone, charge for a pilot, or sign a paid contract, the clock starts. Note the exact date. If unsure whether an activity counts as trading, ask your accountant before doing it.

6. **Delaying the compliance statement** — investors cannot claim tax relief until you file SEIS2/EIS2 and they receive their SEIS3/EIS3 certificate. Delay costs the investor real money (they cannot reduce their tax bill until they have the certificate).

7. **Not checking connected persons** — a friend who is also an advisor or part-time employee may be "connected" and ineligible for relief. Check every investor's relationship to the company.

8. **Assuming SEIS/EIS covers all investors** — overseas investors (non-UK taxpayers) get no benefit from SEIS/EIS. The schemes are only for UK income tax payers. If raising from US or EU angels, SEIS/EIS is irrelevant to them.
