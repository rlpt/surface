# Investor Readiness — Checklist and Guide

Everything you need in place before having serious conversations with angel investors. Organised by priority: do the top sections first, the bottom sections can wait until you have investor interest.

**Current status**: just incorporated, pre-trading, sole founder, no prior investment. Best possible starting position.

## Priority 1: Do now (before any investor conversations)

### IP Assignment Deed

**Why it is the single most important document.**

Right now, everything you have built — code, designs, brand, product concepts, architecture — is owned by you personally, not by the company. You created it. UK copyright law assigns ownership to the creator. The company is a separate legal entity from you. Without an IP assignment, the company is an empty shell that owns nothing.

Every investor will ask: "does the company own all the IP?" If the answer is no, or "we haven't done the paperwork," many will walk away. The IP is what they are investing in. If it is not in the company, they are investing in nothing.

**What it covers:**

- All intellectual property you have created prior to incorporation that relates to the company's business
- All intellectual property you have created since incorporation
- Source code, software, algorithms, databases
- Designs, wireframes, mockups, brand assets
- Business plans, financial models, market research
- Domain names, trade marks (registered or unregistered), trade secrets
- Any work created by contractors or third parties under your direction (you need separate assignments from them)

**Key terms:**

- Assignor: you (Richard Targett)
- Assignee: Formabi Ltd
- Consideration: typically £1, or "in consideration of the shares already held" — the consideration must exist but can be nominal
- Warranties: you warrant that you are the sole owner of the IP, that it does not infringe anyone else's rights, and that there are no encumbrances
- Future IP: include a clause assigning all future IP created in the course of your work for the company (this overlaps with the service agreement)

**When to do it**: now. Before any investor conversation. Date it as close to incorporation as possible. This is a 2-page document — not complex, not expensive.

**Cost**: free if you draft it yourself from a template. £200-500 if a solicitor prepares it.

---

### Founder's Service Agreement

**Why you need a contract with yourself.**

A service agreement (or employment contract) between you and the company formalises your relationship. As a sole founder you are both the employer (the company, acting through its director — you) and the employee (you, as a person). This feels circular but it is structurally important:

1. **Investors check it exists.** It is a due diligence item. "Does the founder have a service agreement?" Yes or no.
2. **It contains the ongoing IP assignment.** The service agreement includes a clause that all IP created during employment belongs to the company. Without it, the IP Assignment Deed covers pre-existing IP but not future work.
3. **It defines your obligations.** Full-time commitment, non-compete, non-solicit, confidentiality. These protect the company (and therefore the investor's money).
4. **It sets salary terms.** Even if your salary is £0, it should be documented. When investors come in, they will want to know what the founder draws. Having a formal agreement that says £0 (to be reviewed by the Board) is clean.
5. **It protects you.** If investors later want to change your terms, the service agreement is your baseline. Without one, there is nothing to negotiate from.

**Key terms:**

| Term | What to include |
|------|-----------------|
| **Role** | CEO / sole director. Full-time commitment. |
| **Salary** | £0 per annum (or a nominal amount). "To be reviewed by the Board following any funding round." |
| **Notice period** | 3-6 months (mutual). Investors will negotiate this — they want enough time to find a replacement if you leave. |
| **IP assignment** | All IP created during employment belongs to the Company. Moral rights waived to the extent permitted by law. |
| **Confidentiality** | Indefinite obligation not to disclose confidential information. |
| **Non-compete** | 6-12 months post-termination. Must be reasonable in scope (same industry, same geography) or it is unenforceable under English law. |
| **Non-solicit** | 6-12 months post-termination. Cannot solicit employees or customers of the Company. |
| **Non-dealing** | 6-12 months post-termination. Cannot deal with customers even if they approach you. Stronger than non-solicit. |
| **Garden leave** | Company can require you to stay at home during notice period. Rarely used for founders but investors like seeing it. |
| **Termination for Cause** | Mirrors the "Cause" definition in articles-of-association.md article 38(b). |
| **Expenses** | Company reimburses reasonable business expenses. |
| **Holiday** | Statutory minimum 28 days (including bank holidays) or whatever you decide. |
| **Pension** | Auto-enrolment obligations apply once you start paying yourself a salary above the threshold (currently £10,000/year). Below that, no obligation. At £0 salary, not applicable. |

**When to do it**: now. Before any investor conversation. This is a standard document — 5-10 pages.

**Cost**: free if you draft from a template. £500-1,000 if a solicitor prepares it.

---

### Cap table

**What it is**: a spreadsheet showing who owns what, how many shares, at what price, what percentage.

**Right now** your cap table is simple:

| Shareholder | Shares | Class | Price paid | % |
|-------------|--------|-------|------------|---|
| Richard Targett | [number] | Ordinary £0.0001 | [nominal value] | 100% |

Check what you actually have:
- How many shares were issued on incorporation?
- What is the nominal value per share?
- Was any share premium paid?

**Common setup for UK startups**: 100 ordinary shares of £1 each (if using the default Companies House formation) or 10,000 shares of £0.0001 each (if formed via an agent with lower nominal value). Lower nominal value is better — it gives you flexibility to issue small numbers of shares to advisors/employees without meaningful cost.

**If you incorporated with £1 shares**: consider a share split before your first investment. Subdivide each £1 share into 10,000 shares of £0.0001 each. This gives you 1,000,000 shares (if you started with 100) which is a much more workable number for issuing options and small tranches to investors. This is a simple board resolution + Companies House filing.

**What investors want to see in a cap table:**

- Current shareholding (pre-money)
- Proposed investment: how many new shares at what price per share
- Post-money shareholding: what percentage each party will hold after the round
- Option pool: most investors will want a 10-15% option pool set aside for future hires, created pre-money (so it dilutes you, not them)
- Fully diluted cap table: showing the effect of all options, warrants, and convertible instruments as if exercised

**Tools**: a spreadsheet is fine at this stage. SeedLegals has a free cap table tool. Carta is overkill for a pre-seed company.

### Company housekeeping

These are the administrative basics that investors check during due diligence. Get them right now so there are no surprises.

| Item | What | How to check | How to fix |
|------|------|-------------|------------|
| **Confirmation statement** | Annual filing to Companies House confirming company details are correct | Check at Companies House website — search for Formabi Ltd | File via Companies House online (£34/year). Due on the anniversary of incorporation and annually thereafter. |
| **PSC register** | Person of Significant Control — you, as 100% shareholder and sole director | Should have been filed on incorporation. Check Companies House listing. | If missing, file PSC01. You are a PSC because you hold >25% of shares and >25% of voting rights. |
| **Registered office** | The official address on the Companies House register. All statutory mail goes here. | Check Companies House listing. | Can be your home address. Can be changed via AD01 form. Consider a registered office service (£50-100/year) if you do not want your home address public. |
| **Statutory registers** | Register of members, register of directors, register of secretaries, register of PSCs | You should have these — they are required by the Act. For a sole-founder company, they are simple one-entry registers. | Create them if you do not have them. They can be kept at the registered office. Many formation agents provide template registers. |
| **Annual accounts** | Financial statements filed at Companies House | Due 9 months after accounting reference date (usually the anniversary of incorporation) | File micro-entity accounts if you qualify (turnover <£632k, balance sheet <£316k, <10 employees). A set of micro-entity accounts costs £0-500 to prepare. |
| **Corporation tax registration** | HMRC registration for corporation tax | Should have been done on incorporation or within 3 months of starting to trade | Register via HMRC online. If not yet trading, you still need to register within 3 months of any activity (including receiving income, employing someone, or buying/selling assets). |
| **Business bank account** | Separate account for the company — not your personal account | You should have this | Open one. Tide, Starling Business, or Monzo Business all offer free accounts for startups. |
| **Accounting records** | You are legally required to keep accounting records from day one | Keep all receipts, invoices, bank statements | Use Xero, FreeAgent, or QuickBooks. Even at £0 revenue, track expenses — they carry forward as losses and reduce future tax. |

## Priority 2: Do before investor conversations start

### NDA template

Have a standard mutual NDA ready. You will use it with:
- Potential advisors
- Potential hires
- Commercial partners
- Anyone who needs to see confidential product details

You will NOT use it with:
- VCs and angel investors (they will not sign — this is industry norm, do not insist)
- Accelerators
- Anyone you are pitching to publicly

**Key terms:**

- Mutual (both parties bound, not one-way)
- 2-year confidentiality period
- Carve-outs: publicly known info, independently developed info, legally compelled disclosure, info known before disclosure
- No obligation to enter into any transaction
- Governing law: England and Wales
- No non-compete or non-solicit (keep it clean — an NDA is about information, not restricting business activity)

**Length**: 2-3 pages. Anything longer signals inexperience.

**Cost**: free templates available from GOV.UK and various law firm websites. £200-300 if a solicitor prepares a bespoke version.

---

### ICO registration

Legal requirement before you process any personal data. This includes:
- A mailing list signup
- Analytics on a website
- Storing email addresses of anyone (investors, contacts, potential customers)
- Using cookies

**Cost**: £40/year for micro organisations (fewer than 10 staff, turnover under £632k)

**How to register**: ico.org.uk — online registration, takes 10 minutes

**What you need after registration**:
- A simple privacy policy on your website (see below)
- A Record of Processing Activities (ROPA) — even a spreadsheet listing what data you collect, why, the lawful basis, and how long you keep it
- Cookie consent on your website if you use analytics or tracking

---

### Privacy Policy and Terms of Service

Required the moment you have any website or product that collects data.

**Privacy Policy must include:**
- Your company name, registered address, and ICO registration number
- What personal data you collect
- Why you collect it (purpose)
- Lawful basis for processing (usually "legitimate interest" or "consent" for a startup)
- How long you keep it
- Who you share it with (analytics providers, hosting providers, payment processors)
- Data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection)
- How to complain (to you, and to the ICO)

**Terms of Service must include:**
- What the service is
- User obligations and acceptable use
- Intellectual property ownership (the product and its content belong to Formabi)
- Limitation of liability (cap at fees paid, exclude consequential damages)
- Governing law: England and Wales
- Termination rights (both sides)
- If targeting consumers: comply with Consumer Rights Act 2015 — unfair terms are void regardless of what you write

---

## Priority 3: Build when you are 3-4 months from raising

### Business plan

5-10 pages. Not a 50-page MBA document. Investors at pre-seed/seed spend 3-4 minutes reading it. Structure:

1. **Problem** (half page) — what pain exists, who feels it, how big the pain is
2. **Solution** (half page) — what you are building, how it solves the problem
3. **Market** (1 page) — TAM/SAM/SOM, who the customers are, market dynamics
4. **Product** (1 page) — what it does, screenshots or wireframes, current state, roadmap
5. **Business model** (half page) — how you make money, pricing, unit economics if available
6. **Traction** (half page) — what you have done so far. Pre-revenue is fine — talk about product progress, user feedback, pilots, waitlist, LOIs
7. **Team** (half page) — you. Why you are the right person to build this. Prior experience, domain expertise, technical capability
8. **Competition** (half page) — who else is in the space, why you are different. Be honest — investors know the market
9. **Financials** (1 page) — summary of the financial model. Revenue projections, cost base, when you break even, how long the runway lasts
10. **The ask** (half page) — how much you are raising, what class of shares, SEIS/EIS qualifying, what the money will be used for

**Also needed for SEIS/EIS advance assurance** — the business plan you write for investors doubles as the one you submit to HMRC with SEIS1/EIS1.

---

### Financial model

A spreadsheet with 3-year monthly projections. Does not need to be complex. Investors know pre-seed projections are mostly fiction — they are testing whether you understand the economics of your business.

**Revenue side:**
- How you charge (subscription? per-seat? per-form? usage-based?)
- Price points
- Customer acquisition assumptions (how many new customers per month)
- Churn assumptions
- Revenue growth trajectory

**Cost side:**
- Your salary (when you start drawing one)
- Hires: when, what role, at what salary
- Infrastructure: hosting, SaaS tools, domains
- Professional services: accountant, solicitor
- Marketing: if any
- Office: if any (probably not at pre-seed)

**Key metrics investors look at:**
- Monthly burn rate (total costs per month)
- Runway (cash in bank / monthly burn)
- Months to breakeven
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) — even if estimated
- Lifetime value (LTV) — even if estimated
- LTV:CAC ratio — should be >3x for a viable business

**Format**: Google Sheets or Excel. Not a PDF — investors want to play with the assumptions.

---

### Pitch deck

10-15 slides. The visual version of your business plan. Structure follows the same order:

1. Title slide — company name, strapline, your name
2. Problem
3. Solution
4. Demo / product screenshots
5. Market size
6. Business model
7. Traction / progress
8. Competition / differentiation
9. Team
10. Financials (summary)
11. The ask — amount, use of funds, SEIS/EIS
12. Contact

**Design**: use the Formabi brand colours. Marp or Google Slides. Keep text minimal — the deck supports a conversation, it does not replace one.

**Two versions:**
- **Presentation deck** — sparse, visual, used when you are presenting live
- **Reading deck** — more text, self-explanatory, used when you email it to an investor who will read it alone

---

### Data room

A folder (Google Drive, Notion, or even a private GitHub repo) containing everything an investor needs during due diligence. Have it ready before they ask — speed signals professionalism.

**Structure:**

```

    ├── business-plan.pdf
    └── executive-summary.pdf                ← 1-2 page version
```

Most of this folder will be empty right now. That is fine. The structure is the point — when an investor asks for something, you know where it goes and can fill it in.

---

## Priority 4: At point of investment

These happen when you have a term sheet or verbal commitment:

| Item | What | Who prepares it |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Adopt bespoke articles** | Special resolution + CC04 filing. See `articles-guide.md`. | You (or solicitor) |
| **Shareholders' agreement** | The commercial deal between shareholders. Sits alongside the articles. Covers: investor rights, information rights, reserved matters, non-compete, drag/tag, leaver provisions, warranties. | Investor's solicitor (usually). You review and negotiate. |
| **Subscription agreement** | The contract for the share purchase. How many shares, at what price, conditions precedent, warranties. | Investor's solicitor (usually). |
| **Disclosure letter** | Your response to the warranties in the subscription agreement. "We warrant X is true, except for the following disclosures..." | You (with solicitor). This is where you disclose anything that might breach a warranty — known risks, outstanding disputes, unusual contracts. |
| **Board resolution to allot** | Formal board resolution authorising the allotment of new shares. Requires s.551 authority. | You (template available). |
| **SH01 return of allotment** | Filed at Companies House within 1 month of allotting shares. | You. |
| **SEIS2/EIS2 compliance statement** | Filed with HMRC after shares are issued. | You. |
| **Share certificates** | Issued to each investor within 2 months. | You. |

**Legal costs at this stage**: budget £3,000-8,000 for a solicitor to handle the investment round. The investor's solicitor prepares most documents; your solicitor reviews them and advises you. At pre-seed/seed, SeedLegals can do this for £1,000-3,000. A traditional law firm charges more.

## The due diligence checklist — what investors will ask for

These are the questions investors (or their solicitors) will ask during due diligence. Every "no" or "we haven't done that" is a friction point. Every "yes, here it is" builds confidence.

### Corporate

- [ ] Certificate of incorporation
- [ ] Current articles of association
- [ ] Register of members (shareholders)
- [ ] Register of directors
- [ ] Register of PSCs
- [ ] All board minutes and resolutions
- [ ] Confirmation statements (up to date?)
- [ ] Any changes to share capital since incorporation
- [ ] Any shareholder agreements or side letters

### Financial

- [ ] Management accounts (monthly P&L, balance sheet)
- [ ] Bank statements (last 6 months)
- [ ] Annual accounts (if due)
- [ ] Corporation tax returns and computations (if due)

- [ ] List of all IP owned by the company (software, trade marks, designs, patents)
- [ ] Domain name registrations (registered to the company, not personally)
- [ ] Any licences of third-party IP used in the product
- [ ] Open source software audit — what open source do you use, under what licences?

### Employment and team

- [ ] **Founder's Service Agreement** — does the founder have a contract? This is question #2.
- [ ] Any other employment contracts or consultancy agreements
- [ ] Share option scheme details (if any)
- [ ] Auto-enrolment pension compliance (if paying salaries)
- [ ] Employment tribunal claims or disputes

### Regulatory and compliance

- [ ] **ICO registration** — are you registered for data protection?
- [ ] GDPR compliance documentation (privacy policy, ROPA, cookie policy)
- [ ] Any sector-specific regulatory requirements
- [ ] Anti-money laundering compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] Any regulatory investigations or sanctions

### Commercial

- [ ] Material contracts (any contract worth >£10k or with a term >12 months)
- [ ] Customer contracts or terms of service
- [ ] Supplier contracts
- [ ] Insurance policies (if any — D&O insurance, professional indemnity)

### Tax

- [ ] **SEIS/EIS advance assurance** — is the company SEIS/EIS qualifying?

- [ ] R&D tax relief claims (if applicable — you may be eligible even pre-revenue)
- [ ] Any HMRC investigations or disputes
