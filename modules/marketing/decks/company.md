# Org Design

Three **product engineers**, each owning a region:

| Region | Time Zone | Coverage |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **UK** | GMT/BST | Europe, Middle East, Africa |
| **Singapore** | SGT | Asia-Pacific |
| **West Coast USA** | PT | Americas |

Handoffs follow the sun — **24 hours of continuous working time**, every day.

# Vibe Coding Ready

Chat-driven interface weaves naturally with designing plans, filling forms, and managing workflows.

- **Customers** vibe code their own solutions
- **Product engineers** vibe code custom integrations for them

---

# Product Engineer Role

Each regional engineer is **full-stack and customer-facing**:

- **Builds the product** — design, implement, ship
- **Runs customer integrations** — onboarding, API setup, data migration
- **Works with regional sales** — demos, technical scoping, deal support

No handoffs between "engineering" and "customer success." The person who builds it is the person who ships it to the customer.

---

# Regional Sales Model

Each product engineer partners with their regional sales team:

- **Sales** finds the customer, qualifies the opportunity
- **Product engineer** runs the technical demo, scopes the integration
- **Together** they close the deal and onboard the customer

The engineer who scoped it is the engineer who delivers it — **zero context loss**.

---

# Velocity

- **Speed** — no coordination overhead, no ticket queues, no waiting
- **Quality** — the builder talks to the customer, feedback loops are instant
- **Coverage** — 24h working, customers get same-day response globally
- **AI-first** — built around an internal AI environment from day one, AI runs alongside the company not bolted on
- **Focus** — small team, no politics, every person ships
