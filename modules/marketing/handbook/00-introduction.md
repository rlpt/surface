# Welcome to Formabi

Welcome to the Formabi company handbook. This is our single source of truth for how we operate, what we believe, and how we work together.

## Who We Are

Formabi makes complex forms easy. We're a small, focused team of product engineers building tools that turn painful, multi-step form workflows into something people actually enjoy using.

## Purpose of This Handbook

This handbook exists to:

- **Onboard new team members** — everything you need to get started in one place
- **Document our practices** — so decisions don't live only in someone's head
- **Stay aligned** — a shared reference we all contribute to

## How to Use This Handbook

Read what's relevant to you. Everything here is a living document — if something is wrong or missing, open a PR. We'd rather have an imperfect handbook that gets updated than a perfect one that nobody maintains.
