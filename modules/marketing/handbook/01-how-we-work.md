# How We Work

We're a distributed, async-first team. Here's how we stay productive without stepping on each other's toes.

## Communication

- **Default to async** — write things down rather than scheduling a call
- **Be explicit** — context doesn't travel well across time zones, so over-communicate intent
- **Respond within a working day** — not instantly, but reliably

## Development Process

We ship small, frequent changes:

1. Pick up a task from the board
2. Branch from `main`, keep changes focused
3. Open a PR with a clear description
4. Get a review, address feedback, merge
5. Deploy happens automatically on merge

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| GitHub | Code, issues, PRs |
| Linear | Task tracking |
| Slack | Real-time chat (sparingly) |
| Loom | Async video updates |

## Decision Making

- **Reversible decisions** — make them quickly, course-correct later
- **Irreversible decisions** — write a short proposal, get team input, then decide
- **Document the "why"** — future-you will thank present-you
