# SEIS/EIS Advance Assurance — Application Draft

Use this document to prepare your HMRC advance assurance application. Advance assurance confirms to prospective investors that the company qualifies for SEIS/EIS tax relief **before** they invest.

## Why This Matters

- **SEIS** — investors get 50% income tax relief on up to £200k invested per tax year
- **EIS** — investors get 30% income tax relief on up to £2m invested per tax year
- Most UK angels and early-stage funds **will not invest without SEIS/EIS eligibility**
- Apply via HMRC's online service or post form SEIS1/EIS1 to the Small Company Enterprise Centre

## Eligibility Checklist

Confirm each of these before applying:

- [ ] Company is incorporated in the UK (Companies House)
- [ ] Company has a permanent establishment in the UK
- [ ] Fewer than 25 employees (SEIS) / fewer than 250 employees (EIS)
- [ ] Gross assets under £350k before investment (SEIS) / under £15m (EIS)
- [ ] Company is less than 3 years old from first commercial sale (SEIS) / less than 7 years (EIS)
- [ ] Company has not raised more than £250k under SEIS previously
- [ ] Company is carrying on, or preparing to carry on, a qualifying trade
- [ ] Company is not listed on a recognised stock exchange
- [ ] No disqualifying arrangements (no guaranteed exits, no loan-back schemes)

## Application Content

### Section 1: Company Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Company name | Formabi Ltd |
| Company number | _[Companies House number]_ |
| Date of incorporation | _[date]_ |
| Registered address | _[address]_ |
| SIC code | 62012 — Business and domestic software development |
| Number of employees | _[number]_ |
| Gross assets | _[value]_ |

### Section 2: Description of Trade

> Formabi develops and sells a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for building and managing complex forms. The platform serves organisations in regulated industries — finance, government, healthcare, insurance — that need structured data collection with conditional logic, entity relationships, real-time collaboration, and immutable audit trails.
>
> The company generates revenue through recurring software subscriptions. Customers pay monthly or annually based on usage tier (number of workspaces, users, and form submissions).
>
> The company's core technology is a purpose-built data engine that provides time-travel capabilities (rewind any form or form design to any point in time), tamper-evident audit logs, and real-time multi-user collaboration. This is proprietary technology built in-house.

### Section 3: Date Trading Commenced (or Expected)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Has the company started trading? | _[Yes/No]_ |
| Date of first commercial sale | _[date, or "Not yet — expected Q_ 20__"]_ |
| Current stage | _[Pre-revenue / Early revenue / etc.]_ |

### Section 4: Amount of Investment Sought

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Amount to be raised under SEIS | _[up to £250k]_ |
| Amount to be raised under EIS | _[amount, if applicable]_ |
| Total funding round | _[amount]_ |
| Number of investors (approx) | _[number]_ |
| Expected date of share issue | _[date]_ |
| Class of shares to be issued | Ordinary shares |

### Section 5: Use of Funds

Describe specifically how the investment will be spent. HMRC wants to see that funds are used for the qualifying trade, not for financial activities.

| Use | Amount | % of Raise |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Product development (engineering salaries) | _£___k_ | __%_ |
| Infrastructure & hosting | _£___k_ | __%_ |
| Sales & marketing | _£___k_ | __%_ |
| Working capital | _£___k_ | __%_ |
| **Total** | **_£___k_** | **100%** |

### Section 6: Share Structure

| Shareholder | Shares | % | Class |
|-------------|--------|---|-------|
| _[Founder 1]_ | _[number]_ | __%_ | Ordinary |
| _[Founder 2]_ | _[number]_ | __%_ | Ordinary |
| _[etc.]_ | _[number]_ | __%_ | Ordinary |
| **New investors (this round)** | _[number]_ | __%_ | Ordinary |

**Important:** SEIS/EIS shares must be full-risk ordinary shares. No preferential rights to dividends or assets, no redemption rights. If you're issuing preference shares to investors alongside ordinary shares, the preference shares will **not** qualify.

### Section 7: Previous Funding

| Date | Source | Amount | Type |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| _[date]_ | _[name]_ | _£___k_ | _[SEIS/EIS/Loan/Grant/Other]_ |

## How to Apply

1. **Online (preferred):** Sign in to HMRC's Enterprise Investment Scheme service via Government Gateway
2. **By post:** Complete form SEIS1 and/or EIS1 and send to:
   > Small Company Enterprise Centre
   > HMRC
   > SO97 1BD

**Turnaround:** Typically 6–8 weeks. Apply early — do not wait until you have investors ready to wire money.

## After Receiving Assurance

Once HMRC confirms eligibility:

1. Issue shares to investors
2. Complete compliance statement (SEIS2/EIS1) within the reporting window
3. HMRC issues SEIS3/EIS3 certificates to each investor
4. Investors claim tax relief on their Self Assessment return

## Common Pitfalls

- **Issuing shares before getting assurance** — the assurance is not retrospective, but the compliance statement is. Get assurance first to de-risk the fundraise.
- **Non-qualifying share classes** — must be ordinary shares with no preferential rights
- **Spending money on non-trading activities** — HMRC may deny if funds go to investments, loans, or non-trade assets
- **Connected persons** — founders and their associates have limits on SEIS/EIS relief they can personally claim
