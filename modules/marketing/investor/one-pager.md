# Formabi — Executive Summary

## Complex Forms Made Easy

Formabi is a SaaS platform for building and managing complex forms, purpose-built for organisations that have outgrown simple form builders but can't justify custom development.

## The Problem

Every regulated industry runs on forms — finance, government, healthcare, insurance, compliance, legal. These organisations face a gap: consumer tools like Typeform and JotForm can't handle conditional logic, entity relationships, or audit requirements. Custom development costs six figures and takes months. There is no middle ground.

## The Solution

Formabi fills the gap with a platform that gives organisations the power of custom-built form systems at the speed and cost of a drag-and-drop builder.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Conditional logic** — show/hide fields, trigger validation, and control navigation based on prior answers, nested to any depth
- **Entity relationships** — forms reference shared organisational data (equipment, personnel, sites) as first-class relationships
- **Real-time collaboration** — multiple users fill the same form simultaneously
- **Immutable audit trail** — every change tracked, nothing ever deleted, full time-travel to any point in history
- **Multi-workspace** — isolated environments with role-based access and cross-workspace shared data
- **Internationalisation** — English, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew with full RTL support
- **API-first** — full OpenAPI spec, webhooks, programmatic form creation, bulk data submission

## Market

The global form automation market is valued at $XX bn and growing at XX% CAGR. Formabi targets the underserved mid-complexity segment — organisations with 100–10,000 employees in regulated industries who currently spend £50k–£500k on custom form solutions or live with inadequate tools.

_Target sectors:_ energy, maritime, construction, healthcare, financial services, government.
